# HBM_Dyslexia_Classification
Code for nested linear svm &amp; logistic classifcation in HBM paper (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.23112/abstract)
A nested corss validation was applied, with inner cross validation for P threshold selection, outer cross validation for classifier evaluation.

Ttest_SVM_2group_PSelection_SGE.m and Ttest_LR_2group_PSelection_SGE.m are main functions for LSVM and logistic regression, respectively.
